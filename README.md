Star Wars Character Application
Welcome to the Star Wars Character Application! This simple web application allows you to explore information about various characters from the Star Wars universe.

Introduction
This project utilizes a Node.js backend to create a custom API that mimics the Star Wars API /people endpoint. The frontend is built with React.js and styled with CSS to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

Features
API: A custom API is created in Node.js to fetch a list of Star Wars characters.
CRUD Operations: Users can add, edit, and delete characters from the application.
Loading Indicator: A loading indicator is displayed while data is being fetched or refetched.
Error Handling: Graceful error handling is implemented, especially when the API server is down.
Character Cards: Each character is displayed as a card with their name and a randomly sourced picture.
Card Styling: Cards are colored based on the character's species, providing visual distinction.
Hover Animation: Cards feature a hover animation effect for enhanced interactivity.
Character Details Modal: Clicking on a character card opens a modal displaying detailed information about the character.
Modal Content: The modal includes the character's name as the header, along with information about their height, mass, birth year, and date added to the API. It also shows the number of films the character appears in and fetches details about their homeworld, including its name, terrain, climate, and the number of residents.
High-Quality Code: Emphasis is placed on maintaining good coding standards, ensuring a maintainable application architecture.
Testing: Unit tests are implemented to validate the functionality of the application.
